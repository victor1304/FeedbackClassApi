# FeedbackClassApi
Xamarin.Forms Mobile Application
App: github.com/victor1304/FeedbackClassApp

Mobile app built for University teachers, providing the possibility for the students to give feedback based on pre-defined questions by the teacher.

The method is secure, because a temporary six-number PIN is generated upon sharing the feedback questions with the class.

The teacher can view the history of answered questions at any time later.

Xamarin.Forms + Dependency Services + SQLite + .NET Core
